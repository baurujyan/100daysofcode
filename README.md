# 100 Days of Code - Python Projects

**About**

This repository contains the Python projects I am working on as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge. I am embarking on this 100-day coding journey to consistently learn and improve my Python programming skills.

**Projects**

Throughout the 100 days, I will be building various Python applications and projects to consolidate my understanding of the language. Each project will focus on teaching me new concepts, techniques, and best practices.

**Progress**

I am currently on Day 4 of the 100 Days of Code challenge. So far, the experience has been positive as I continue to learn the basics of Python.
